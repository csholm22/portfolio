                            Thank you for the work to get us to today's milestone review with Patty. It went great
                            thanks to your work and collaboration. Especially want to call out your persistence and
                            ability to make progress at times when we weren't sure of requirements or next steps.
                            Appreciate the hard work -- and especially the teamwork. Thank you and have a good holiday!

                            Chris has been crucial for the UX team in onboarding and acclimating us to the culture of
                            LHI. He is a great resource for all of our questions related to the Portals and processes of
                            the company. He has solid relationships with leadership and includes any relevant info to
                            our team, that we would otherwise not be aware of. His candor, openness to listening to the
                            team with new ideas is much appreciated. Raised hands to Chris!

                            Chris was eager to jump in and lend a helping hand when I began to identify digital
                            communication enhancements for one of our contracts. He was not the accountable UX designer
                            assigned to the work, but was willing to bring his top-notch UX/UI and contract knowledge to
                            the table without hesitation. He went even further to follow-up with suggested tools that
                            will aid in my research to enhance our communication data. While working together it was
                            apparent Chris had the end user top of mind in addition to being a reliable and supportive
                            colleague. Thank you Chris for your help, dedication to the organization, and collaboration!
                            You made a new comer feel very welcome.

                            Chris, I don't think the Rebid team could have defined their completely revamped process for
                            managing cases without you there to facilitate the workshop. You spent 4 days in a room with
                            15-20 people and managed to wireframe a brand new interface for them to use only a couple
                            days later. Thank you for the amazing work!

                            I don't know what I would have done the last four months without Chris. Four new team
                            members (new to the company) were added to the UX team since March and despite being
                            responsible for a few different products, Chris never shied away from sharing his knowledge
                            or mentoring anyone one-on-one. On top of that, he had to take on the workload of two senior
                            members--increasing his product total to six or so. Despite everything, Chris is STILL
                            producing high quality work. Thank you for all that you've done Chris! The team and I
                            appreciate it!

                            Chris killed it on external 508 auditor findings. Under a tight turn around time, he mocked
                            up new LHI.Care Dashboard Cards and a game plan to then discuss with the external auditor.
                            Chris came prepared to discuss the User Experience behind our new mockup. The meeting went
                            extremely well in part to Chris. There was a little back and forth with the auditor, a
                            solution was identified that made everyone happy and gave our team a clear path forward to
                            update our 508 compliance findings. Because of Chris' articulate explanation of the User
                            Experience behind our site and his professionalism, the meeting went exceptionally well.

                            Provider Reimagine project from a UX/UI standpoint. Without delay, Chris jumped into the
                            project, met with team members, and produced deliverables that will allow the team to
                            continue to progress at a rapid pace. Chris's tremendous skill as a UX/UI professional is
                            matched by his integrity, and he always proves himself (often very quickly, such as in this
                            case) a valued member of any team he is on.

                        <p>
                            Chris really knocked it out of the park with some amazing UX mockups delivered super
                            quickly. We were in a really rough spot with the Provider Reimagine project with well over
                            one hundred storypoints to build this sprint, but almost no UX framework to build off of.
                            Chris jumped in on the project, collaborated with us on what was needed, and then delivered
                            several extremely high quality mockups before the weekend. Our developers now have a very
                            solid guideline to build towards, and I believe our users will be quite happy with the
                            results.
