        <h2>
            Summary
        </h2>

        <p>
            Over the past two years, I have worked with multiple software dev teams to create many enhancements and
            features. The high-level goal is to improve workflows, improve business KPIs, and increase the speed of
            onboarding new
            customer service representatives.
        </p>

        <h2>

            Problems
        </h2>

        <p>

            Healthcare Coordinators were drowning in redundant tasks because the system they had just transitioned to
            was
            designed for another user group's workflow.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Outcomes
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Improved the users' quality of life and workflow by removing redundant manual tasks and adding
                configurable
                flexibility to the system.
            </li>

            <li>
                Task completion times improved by roughly 300%.
            </li>

        </ul>

            <li>
                Remove redundant tasks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Create ways to complete multiple tasks with less clicks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Change system workflow to match the users' workflow.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h2>
            Constraints
        </h2>

        <p>
            We needed to work within the current tech stack and only involve changes to the frontend and APIs. No
            changes
            cou;d
            be made to the database.
        </p>

        <p>
            Research, design, and prototyping needed to be completed within 2 sprints and needed to happen while
            juggling
            two
            other high-priority projects.
        </p>

                Process
            </h2>

                Understand
            </h3>

            <p>
                Empathize, Define: The Healthcare Coordinators had transitioned to our new system for a few months and
                found
                that
                they were drowning in redundant tasks. During the initial project kickoff with the business
                stakeholders,
                the group
                identified that the MVP (Minimally Viable Product) solution, which IT initially built for a different
                user
                group's
                workflow, wasn't giving the Healthcare Coordinator group the KPI improvements that they had hoped.
                Define: We mapped the current state of the process and scenarios where frustrations took place.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Explore
            </h3>

            <p>
                Ideate: We did a "how might we" exercise to help document everyone's ideas for potential solutions to
                their
                frustrations. The group then selected the concepts that we wanted to investigate further.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prototype: Two of the improvements just involved reusing existing functionality in other areas of the
                applications.
                For these updates, I created quick wireframes for the devs to work from so they could be implemented in
                the
                next
                sprint.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prototype: For the more complicated implementations, I made proto-personas and mapped what the user flow
                could be. I
                made a prototype to give the stakeholder group something to interact with and give feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Materialize
            </h3>


            <p>
                Test: I had a follow-up meeting with the dev teams, business stakeholders, and Healthcare Coordinators
                to
                validate
                the proposed changes. Except for a few minor changes, the consensus was that the solution would meet the
                needs of
                all groups.
            </p>


            <p>
                Implement: I made the requested revisions and then worked with the dev team to start breaking down the
                work
                in the
                product backlog.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Understand
            </h3>

            <p>
                Empathize, Define: Once development was complete and released to production, we had bi-weekly meetings
                to
                get
                feedback from business operations stakeholders.
